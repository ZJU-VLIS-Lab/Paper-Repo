Many therapists include commercial motion-based videogames in their therapy sessions to help make rehabilitation exercises fun and engaging. Our initial exploratory work exposed a need for tools to help therapists make evidence-based decisions when choosing commercial motion-games for their patients who have had a BI. Targeting this need, we are gathering requirements for a case-based recommender (CBR) system that will act as a decision tool for therapists. In this paper, we describe our ongoing work as a case study that illustrates our multi-method approach of requirement elicitation for the CBR system. Our approach is comprised of four overlapping steps: (1) interviews with therapists, (2) onsite observations of therapy game sessions, (3) diary studies in which therapists record detailed information about game sessions, and (4) a user study of a CBR prototype interface. Leveraging direct interaction with end users (i.e., therapists), this case study demonstrates requirements gathering techniques to address needs of a special population (i.e., therapists who work with patients who had BIs) in a specialized context (i.e., inpatient rehabilitation using motion-based video games)."

        title="Missing requirements are known to be among the  
major sources of software failure. Incompleteness often results  
from poor anticipation of what could go wrong with an over-ideal  
system. Obstacle analysis is a model-based, goal-anchored form  
of risk analysis aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving  
exceptional conditions that may obstruct the behavioral goals of  
the target system. The obstacle resolution step is obviously  
crucial as it should result in more adequate and more complete  
requirements. In contrast with obstacle identification and  
assessment, however, this step has little support beyond a palette  
of resolution operators encoding tactics for producing isolated  
countermeasures to single risks. In particular, there is no single  
clue to date as to where and how such countermeasures should be  
integrated within a more robust goal model.  
  
To address this problem, the paper describes a systematic  
technique for integrating obstacle resolutions as countermeasure  
goals into goal models. The technique is shown to guarantee  
progress towards a complete goal model; it preserves the

              Missing requirements are known to be among the  
major sources of software failure. Incompleteness often results  
from poor anticipation of what could go wrong with an over-ideal  
system. Obstacle analysis is a model-based, goal-anchored form  
of risk analysis aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving  
exceptional conditions that may obstruct the behavioral goals of  
the target system. The obstacle resolution step is obviously  
crucial as it should result in more adequate and more complete  
requirements. In contrast with obstacle identification and  
assessment, however, this step has little support beyond a palette  
of resolution operators encoding tactics for producing isolated  
countermeasures to single risks. In particular, there is no single  
clue to date as to where and how such countermeasures should be  
integrated within a more robust goal model.  
  
To address this problem, the paper describes a systematic  
technique for integrating obstacle resolutions as countermeasure  
goals into goal models. The technique is shown to guarantee  
progress towards a complete goal model; it preserves the  
correctness of refinements in the overall model; and keeps the  
original, ideal model visible to avoid cluttering the latter with a  
combinatorial blow-up of exceptional cases. To allow for this, the  
goal specification language is slightly extended in order to  
capture exceptions to goals seperately and distinguish normal  
situations from exceptional ones. The proposed technique is  
evaluated on a non-trivial ambulance dispatching system.

              Just-in-time requirements management, characterized by lightweight representation and continuous refinement of requirements, fits many iterative and incremental development projects. Being lightweight and flexible, however, can cause wasteful and procrastinated implementation, leaving certain stakeholder goals not satisfied. This paper proposes traceability-enabled refactoring aimed at fulfilling more requirements fully. We make a novel use of requirements traceability to accurately locate where the software should be refactored, and develop a new scheme to precisely determine what refactorings should be applied to the identified places. Our approach is evaluated through an industrial study. The results show that our approach recommends refactorings more appropriately than a contemporary recommender. Keywords: requirements management; just-in-time requirements; traceability; refactoring;

              Bankdata and Mjølner have cooperated in the development of a new feature for 12 Danish mobile banking apps. Bankdata is the main system provider and Mjølner is subcontractor. Different teams from Bankdata have collected requirements, developed the necessary backend and middleware software, and designed the user interface. One team from Mjølner has implemented the app feature. The cooperation between the teams was centered around design-level requirements. Our contribution is to describe and discuss a number of lessons learned regarding requirements representations, requirements tools, and cooperation process; we have faced challenges, which were amplified by our distributed teams set-up. We also briefly describe a number of initiatives we have launched recently to alleviate the problems and improve the handling of design-level requirements in our future cooperation.

              In the modern automotive industry, feature models have been widely used as a domain-specific requirements model, which can capture commonality and variability of a software product line through a set of features. Product variants can thus be configured by selecting different sets of features from the feature model. For feature-oriented requirements validation, the variability of feature sets often makes the hidden flaws such as behavioral inconsistencies of features, hardly to avoid. In this paper, we present an approach to feature-oriented requirements validation for automotive systems w.r.t both functional behaviors and non-functional properties. Our approach first starts with the behavioral specification of features and the associated requirements by following a restricted use case modeling approach, and then formalizes such specifications by using a formal yet literate language for analysis.

Therefore business process and regulations compliance analysis audit and management tasks take a very important role in daily operational activities for each organization. Due to high complexity this task can become challenging. In some domains regulations are changing rapidly. Process models must be flexible and easy adjustable to changing requirements, since the lack of ability to comply with regulations can lower down the competitiveness of an organizations. Thus, rapid changes of regulations require rapid changes of related business processes. The goal of the PhD work is to develop business process and regulations compliance management technology which should enable business process construction from regulations and change monitoring of regulations and business processes to ensure easy and rapid modification of business process model or regulations, thus also ensuring compliance."

In this interactive panel, teams of researchers, representing different requirements engineering research areas, bring ideas for technology transfer to a panel of industrial and government practitioners. The teams make interactive presentations and receive feedback from panelists. Beneath the game-show genre of the panel is the serious goal to foster conversation between practitioners and researchers to improve the effectiveness of technology transfer in the requirements engineering community."
