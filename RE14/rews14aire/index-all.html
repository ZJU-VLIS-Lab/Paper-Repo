Pragmatic ambiguities depend on the context of a requirement, which includes the background knowledge of the reader: different backgrounds can lead to different interpretations. The presented approach employs a graph-based modelling of the background knowledge of different readers, and uses a shortest-path search algorithm to model the pragmatic interpretation of a requirement. The comparison of different pragmatic interpretations is used to decide if a requirement is ambiguous or not.

        title="We describe an approach to the representation of requirements using answer set programming and how this leads to a vision for the role of artificial intelligence techniques in software engineering with a particular focus on adaptive business systems. We outline how the approach has developed over several years through a combination of commercial software development and artificial intelligence research, resulting in: (i) a metamodel that incorporates the notion of runtime requirements, (ii) a formal language for their representation and its supporting computational model (InstAL), and (iii) a software architecture that enables monitoring of distributed systems. The metamodel is the result of several years experience in the development of business systems for e-tailing, while InstAL and the runtime monitor is on-going research to support the specification, verification and application of normative frameworks in distributed intelligent systems. Our approach derives from the view that in order to build agile systems, the components need to be structured more like software that controls robots, in that it is designed to be relatively resilient in the face of a non-deterministic, dynamic, complex environment about which there is incomplete information. Thus, degrees of autonomy become a strength and an opportunity, but must somehow be constrained by informing these autonomous components what should be done in a certain situation or what system state ought to be achieved through norms as expressions of requirements. Because such a system made up of autonomous components is potentially behaviourally complex and not just complicated, it becomes essential to monitor both whether norms/requirements are being fulfilled and if not why not. Finally, because control over the system can be expressed through requirements in the form of data that can be changed, a route is opened to adjustment and dynamic re-direction of running systems."

              Many AI techniques have been applied to goal-oriented requirements engineering. However, such techniques have focused mostly on the intellectual challenge and ignored the engineering challenge of RE at scale. We discuss some of these existing approaches. We then introduce some early work that aims to add contextual quality attribute information to leverage the power of AI techniques and tools with real-world engineering. We believe this will address some of the acquisition and context problems that have plagued AI in RE.

In each case, this provides a semantics for the notation, on which we can base the definition of forward (&quot;what if?&quot;) and backward (&quot;how is this achievable?&quot;) reasoning, of interest to requirements engineers. We consider the manner in which AI KR&amp;R research provides off-the-shelf algorithms that can be used to solve these tasks. We compare the representations by reporting known worst-case complexity results for the reasoning, as well as other criteria such as size/understandability of axiomatization, and ease of extension of modeling language."
