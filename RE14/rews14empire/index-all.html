In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years.

        title="The rapid and worldwide diffusion of applications for smartphones (apps hereafter) has produced a complex ecosystem composed by users, apps, developers and vendors with sometimes contrasting and sometimes matching interests. In the literature, this ecosystem has been investigated from multiple perspectives with different kinds of empirical approaches, however some crucial dimensions are still unexplored. 
In this paper we adopt the perspective of Requirements Engineering. We are interested in collecting empirical observations on users&#039; perception of the risks associated to apps when they decide about which app to select and install on their smartphone. Which apps&#039; requirements do users consider? How do they evaluate them with respect to benefits, security and privacy risks? 
How users decide about this is still unclear. 
We think that relevant variables and underlying dynamics must be identified before we can successfully conduct large-scale controlled experiments, as it is already done in other fields of software engineering. 
This paper presents the design of an observational study proposed to explore how users assess features and costs/risks when installing apps.  
The experimental design is then validated and adopted in a feasibility study with a limited set of participants. Preliminary findings are summarised in a set of observations and then discussed in terms of their potential impacts on the app ecosystem."

        title="There are myriads of security elicitation techniques reported in the literature, but their industrial adoption is inadequate. Furthermore there is a shortage of empirical and comparative evaluations which can aid the software industry in this respect. This paper compares two security elicitation techniques – Misuse cases (MUC) and Issue based information systems (IBIS) by carrying out controlled experiments. A 2*2 factorial design was used with 30 undergraduate students selected randomly who solved security goal identification tasks on an individual basis using the two techniques. Two dependent variables chosen were; effectiveness of the techniques in terms of number of security goals identified and coverage of the techniques in terms of number of types of security goals, time taken to learn, execute and interpret results by each technique in three different situations. The main finding was that in a situation of low level of detail, the time taken to interpret results was lower in IBIS while in medium and high level of detail MUC is more effective for finding security goals and provides better coverage by taking less learning time. The generality of the results is limited due to the fact that undergraduate students participated in the experiment. The study provides guideline for the software industry about the choice of security elicitation technique in three different situations. The study can be extended by adding multiple techniques for comparison and a framework can be developed."

        title="Requirements engineering (RE) often needs creativity in a form where interactions among stakeholders are particularly important: collaborative creativity. However, few studies have explicitly concentrated on understanding collaborative creativity in RE, resulting in a lack of well-founded advice for practitioners on how to support this aspect of RE. Through an online survey, this paper seeks empirical validation for a framework of factors characterising collaborative creative processes in RE. Within the limits of the validity of the study, the results show support for the utility of the framework: collaborative creativity seems to be a linear function of the mean score to all factors in the framework. Factors can be grouped, and the specific impact of each group on collaboration, value and novelty can be assessed."

              Requirements engineering (RE) often needs creativity in a form where interactions among stakeholders are particularly important: collaborative creativity. However, few studies have explicitly concentrated on understanding collaborative creativity in RE, resulting in a lack of well-founded advice for practitioners on how to support this aspect of RE. Through an online survey, this paper seeks empirical validation for a framework of factors characterising collaborative creative processes in RE. Within the limits of the validity of the study, the results show support for the utility of the framework: collaborative creativity seems to be a linear function of the mean score to all factors in the framework. Factors can be grouped, and the specific impact of each group on collaboration, value and novelty can be assessed.

        title="The need to consider context in order to understand 
requirements is established in requirements engineering. 
Recently, this has been discussed more intensively for socio-technical 
systems, which offer a rich spectrum of different

to model requirements together with the context they are 
valid in, but there is a lack of research on how to derive 
them from stakeholder needs. Our goal in this paper is 
to explore the usefulness of existing requirements elicitation 
techniques for the identification of contextual requirements 
early, i.e. at design time. In a case study we investigate end-user 
viewpoints, together with interviews, scenarios, prototyping, 
goal-based analysis, and groupwork as a means to elicit and 
clarify contextual requirements already at design time. In our 
case study a certain combination of the applied requirements 
elicitation techniques stood out as most beneficial for the identification 
of contextual requirements. In addition, we discovered 
valuable indicators of differences in the operative context, for 
example when end-users cannot agree on refinements of specific 
requirements. Designers and operators of adaptive systems 
might benefit by taking such conflicts and resulting contextual 
requirements into account."
