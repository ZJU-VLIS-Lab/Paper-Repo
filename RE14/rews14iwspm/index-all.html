        title="Innovation management of automotive control systems is a challenging issue not least because of the need to handle short iterative life cycles and families of these systems. After collecting experience in control engineering from a three year collaboration in the automotive domain, we conclude that innovation management is only weakly aligned with feature and platform development.  
This situation makes it difficult to assure feasibility of innovations and to identify potentials for innovations.  
  
We present a novel approach to integrating innovation management with requirements and technology management by using behavioral system models. We investigate requirements-based and technology-based innovation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to using such models for managing feature and platform innovations in an automotive company. We discuss an example to illustrate how our approach can be applied."

        title="To prevent issues arising from legacy software platforms, adapting to changing customer needs by software evolution is a growing concern of software organizations. However, current practices are pragmatic and subjective, which restricts benchmarking and reduces efficiency. In order to improve evolutionary practices, this paper proposes the Software Functionality Evolution Method (SFEM). The SFEM provides a software vendor with input for product roadmapping, by mapping functionality between software platforms. Mappings are based on characteristics and constraints of functionality, personas and software platforms. An incremental method engineering approach is put to practice, in which the template method is instantiated and improved over multiple cases. Cases show that the method contributes to efficient reasoning and strategic decision making in software evolution for software product managers."

        title="How to achieve alignment of software product management with software architecture and whether there is a business case for doing so is scientifically unknown. Yet, software architecture has large, direct impact on product success factors: creating a winning product and delivering value to customers. In this exploratory case study paper we identify the most critical processes for SPM and SA alignment: requirements gathering and refinement. These processes require effective communication supported by high level architectural views. Our respondents, however, rely on simple methods due to their negative experiences with formalized models. Based on these findings, we propose the Accurate Architectural Models Approach (AAMA) which prevents architectural model divergence."

An extensive literature review has identified that brand inertia, customer inertia, inappropriate market entry strategies and an inability to satisfy customer needs or expectations are the principle contributors to customer product rejection. While RE practice has developed a number of methodologies for addressing aspects of the contributing factors to these failures, very little prior work has focused on the inertia aspects of the problem. In this work we present the results of our literature review and build upon this review to develop an initial framework for incorporating stakeholder inertia into RE practice and management processes.
