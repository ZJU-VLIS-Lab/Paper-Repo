              IT has changed business model and business process, and has become an essential ingredient for the competitive advantage. Under such circumstances, a conventional requirements engineering methodology is not sufficient. We propose an IT-driven business model design methodology in order to take advantage of innovative information technologies. The proposed methodology includes XBMC (eXtended BMC), an extension of BMC (Business Model Canvas) of BMG (Business Model Generation) as a framework to visualize a business architecture with a holistic view, and SMC (System Model Canvas) as a new model to visualize overall system architecture, correspondingly. In addition, we propose BSTM (Business-System Translation Meta-model) to align business architecture and system architecture based on the business meta-model and goal model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by applying it to the case of a mobile music delivery business.

              The knowledge captured in business process models is essential to identify user requirements of the process aware information system to execute the processes. Frequently, relations between the models and requirements are either not established or only partially available. This results in increased effort, broken traceability, completeness and consistency problems for user requirements. We proposed a unified business process modeling method, UPROM, to analyze and develop models for business processes and user requirements. These models are utilized to automatically generate textual user requirements. We present a multiple case study to evaluate UPROM in two e-government projects initiated for developing workflow management systems. We applied UPROM to identify most of the user requirements and prepare the technical contracts. The multiple case study shows that by applying UPROM, user requirements and business processes can be analyzed in a unified way and textual requirements can be generated automatically. The results proved to be helpful in real life settings.

              In recent years, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has evolved to one of the most applied modelling General Purpose Languages (GPL) in the Business Process Management discipline. Due to its application in different domains, it becomes frequently necessary to extend the BPMN by domain-specific concepts. Extending the BPMN fosters an adequate communication between system engineers and domain experts and enhances the semantically well-defined representation of the domain. Therefore, the BPMN meta-model provides an extension mechanism for the definition of valid domain-specific elements. However, there is a remarkable lack in procedure models for the design of such extensions. This research article outlines an extension method that focuses on domain analysis, extension requirements and the derivation of domain-specific extension concepts within BPMN. Therefore, the method of STROPPI ET AL. (2011) is extended in regard to domain analysis. The approach is motivated and demonstrated by the case of clinical pathways.

              This paper describes an industrial experience of requirements engineering for the business process improvement in one of the biggest electronics companies in Korea. To improve the definition of the TV department business process requirements, we have applied a few methods to facilitate communications amongst stakeholders, based on their requirements. Our methods include iterative review processes, shared templates, and professional technical writing training. After applying our methods in a pilot project, the project stakeholders have confirmed that the approach provides a better requirements understanding and has improved requirements elicitation for the given examples. While implementing the project, we were also able to learn about both technical and nontechnical obstacles. Nontechnical obstacles were created by the organizational culture, including issues such as reduced empowerment, low levels of communication with other stakeholders, and a non-uniformly defined and not clearly understood mission statement. Most of the developers are very good at accomplishing their goals. They are very quick to respond to their management’s requests, without excuses. However, often times, stakeholders have usually emphasized the importance of the results, rather than focusing on developing a strong quality process. The quality of work was highly dependent on the product development process. Therefore, in this study, the authors have analyzed the impact on the requirements gathering created by the stakeholders having a manufacturing process background and evaluating most decisions from a manufacturing perspective. The impact of the national cultural work style on the requirements engineering processes was also examined. In the future, we will continue to apply and expand the mentioned findings to further improve the requirements business process management.

              Universities tackle with requirement elicitation for suitable IT support. The integration of stakeholders is challenging. Furthermore, business processes in administration, education and research of universities are not available for all subjects or not with necessary details. IT departments work in traditional ways to provide IT systems. A coupling between university governance and IT organization with regard to content is missing mostly. IT frameworks like ITIL and COBIT are promising to achieve an alignment of the IT to business demands. However, the frameworks need an adaption to university contexts. Furthermore a cultural change might be necessary to enable universities for the application of such frameworks – an organizational development of IT might help as well as the introduction of IT service management and IT governance.

              The analysis of requirements for Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) can be very challenging, since prospective users often do not have a clear idea of a DSML.  
This is especially the case if prospective users lack a technical background.  
This paper reports on the use of a dedicated method to support the analysis of requirements for DSMLs in hospitals.  
Apart from an elaborate process model, the method recommends developing a specific kind of use scenarios that serve as a medium to get users involved.  
The presented work was part of a larger project that is aimed at developing multi-perspective hospital models.

              The analysis of requirements for Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) can be very challenging, since prospective users often do not have a clear idea of a DSML.  
This is especially the case if prospective users lack a technical background.  
This paper reports on the use of a dedicated method to support the analysis of requirements for DSMLs in hospitals.  
Apart from an elaborate process model, the method recommends developing a specific kind of use scenarios that serve as a medium to get users involved.  
The presented work was part of a larger project that is aimed at developing multi-perspective hospital models.

              IT has changed business model and business process, and has become an essential ingredient for the competitive advantage. Under such circumstances, a conventional requirements engineering methodology is not sufficient. We propose an IT-driven business model design methodology in order to take advantage of innovative information technologies. The proposed methodology includes XBMC (eXtended BMC), an extension of BMC (Business Model Canvas) of BMG (Business Model Generation) as a framework to visualize a business architecture with a holistic view, and SMC (System Model Canvas) as a new model to visualize overall system architecture, correspondingly. In addition, we propose BSTM (Business-System Translation Meta-model) to align business architecture and system architecture based on the business meta-model and goal model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by applying it to the case of a mobile music delivery business.

              This paper describes an industrial experience of requirements engineering for the business process improvement in one of the biggest electronics companies in Korea. To improve the definition of the TV department business process requirements, we have applied a few methods to facilitate communications amongst stakeholders, based on their requirements. Our methods include iterative review processes, shared templates, and professional technical writing training. After applying our methods in a pilot project, the project stakeholders have confirmed that the approach provides a better requirements understanding and has improved requirements elicitation for the given examples. While implementing the project, we were also able to learn about both technical and nontechnical obstacles. Nontechnical obstacles were created by the organizational culture, including issues such as reduced empowerment, low levels of communication with other stakeholders, and a non-uniformly defined and not clearly understood mission statement. Most of the developers are very good at accomplishing their goals. They are very quick to respond to their management’s requests, without excuses. However, often times, stakeholders have usually emphasized the importance of the results, rather than focusing on developing a strong quality process. The quality of work was highly dependent on the product development process. Therefore, in this study, the authors have analyzed the impact on the requirements gathering created by the stakeholders having a manufacturing process background and evaluating most decisions from a manufacturing perspective. The impact of the national cultural work style on the requirements engineering processes was also examined. In the future, we will continue to apply and expand the mentioned findings to further improve the requirements business process management.

              The analysis of requirements for Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) can be very challenging, since prospective users often do not have a clear idea of a DSML.  
This is especially the case if prospective users lack a technical background.  
This paper reports on the use of a dedicated method to support the analysis of requirements for DSMLs in hospitals.  
Apart from an elaborate process model, the method recommends developing a specific kind of use scenarios that serve as a medium to get users involved.  
The presented work was part of a larger project that is aimed at developing multi-perspective hospital models.

              In recent years, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has evolved to one of the most applied modelling General Purpose Languages (GPL) in the Business Process Management discipline. Due to its application in different domains, it becomes frequently necessary to extend the BPMN by domain-specific concepts. Extending the BPMN fosters an adequate communication between system engineers and domain experts and enhances the semantically well-defined representation of the domain. Therefore, the BPMN meta-model provides an extension mechanism for the definition of valid domain-specific elements. However, there is a remarkable lack in procedure models for the design of such extensions. This research article outlines an extension method that focuses on domain analysis, extension requirements and the derivation of domain-specific extension concepts within BPMN. Therefore, the method of STROPPI ET AL. (2011) is extended in regard to domain analysis. The approach is motivated and demonstrated by the case of clinical pathways.

              The analysis of requirements for Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) can be very challenging, since prospective users often do not have a clear idea of a DSML.  
This is especially the case if prospective users lack a technical background.  
This paper reports on the use of a dedicated method to support the analysis of requirements for DSMLs in hospitals.  
Apart from an elaborate process model, the method recommends developing a specific kind of use scenarios that serve as a medium to get users involved.  
The presented work was part of a larger project that is aimed at developing multi-perspective hospital models.
