              The Brazilian federal government regulates the process for procurement of Information Technology (IT) solutions through specific legislation named Regulatory Instruction - RI Nº 04/2010. This process consists of three phases: procurement planning, supplier selection and contract management. This work helps (i) specify and validate an approach for traceability between legal requirements and documents created in the procurement process of IT solutions; (ii) reduce manual work for the verification of legal compliance in the set of artifacts produced; and (iii) support activities of auditing and inspection during and after the procurement of IT solutions by the Brazilian federal government.
