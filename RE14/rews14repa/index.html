The characteristics of such requirements are manifold: they need to be understandable to each of the stakeholders and they should be processable by computers, for example, to analyze or to trace requirements across many steps during the system development process. For this purpose, a controlled natural language (CNL) can be used to specify textual requirements. Thus, it is possible to define the allowed syntax of requirements, but this does not consider the semantic content. With semantic annotations of a formal grammar (so-called SemanticPatterns), it is possible to capture the semantic dependencies within textual requirements and to transform them into an ontology, and this ontology is used to check the consistency of whole requirement specifications and also between the specification and other design artifacts. This paper presents an approach using a formal grammar with semantic annotations to formalize textual requirements and to make it processable by computers. The formulation and consistency check of several automotive requirements are shown based on the prototypical tool GO-Editor."

On the other hand, we want to provide a mechanism for guiding the stakeholders (non-computing as well as computing people) through the requirement elicitation process in these domains. The approach is based on Feature Modeling, a variability modeling technique used in Software Product Lines. Furthermore, a tablet app has been developed to support the approach. We demonstrate the approach for two different domains, the domain of serious games for children and the domain of e-shop web applications.

In this paper, we study the privacy patterns for mobile operating systems. We elicit privacy-related requirements in three ways - knowledge from domain experts, literature review on public documents of existing mature systems and feedback from real users. Based on these requirements, we propose 7 privacy patterns which are presented with the RePa Requirements Pattern Template. All of these patterns were refined by professional business analysts which concrete the result of our work.

In the paper we investigate the Structured Elicitation of Non-functional Requirements(SENoR) method. The method is composed of a sequence of short brainstorming sessions driven by ISO25010 quality characteristics. It uses Non-functional Requirements Templates (NoRTs) to support the elicitation process. Our exploratory case study on cost and effectiveness of SENoR and NoRTs included 7 projects that developed tailor-made web applications. The findings show that two 1.5-hour elicitation workshops can result in non-functional requirements of stability at the level of 80%."

              It is still an open question how to achieve a proper balance between the cost and value of requirements elicitation. When deciding to assign time and other resources to elicitation, one needs to know what its effectives would be. In the paper we investigate the Structured Elicitation of Non-functional Requirements(SENoR) method. The method is composed of a sequence of short brainstorming sessions driven by ISO25010 quality characteristics. It uses Non-functional Requirements Templates (NoRTs) to support the elicitation process. Our exploratory case study on cost and effectiveness of SENoR and NoRTs included 7 projects that developed tailor-made web applications. The findings show that two 1.5-hour elicitation workshops can result in non-functional requirements of stability at the level of 80%.
