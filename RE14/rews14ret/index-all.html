The objective of RET is to explore the interaction of Requirements Engineering (RE) and Testing in research and industry, and the challenges that result from this interaction. While much work has been done in the respective fields of requirements engineering and testing, there exists much more than can be done to understand the connection between RE and Testing processes.  
  
We hope RET will provide a much needed forum for exchanging ideas and best practices for aligning RE and Testing, and in particular can help foster industry-academia collaboration on this topic, and thereby connect the communities of RE and Testing."

If the activities involved in RET are not aligned, effort is inevitably wasted, and the probability of delivering high quality software products in time decreases. Previous work has identified sixteen challenges in aligning RET in a case study of six companies. However, all six case companies selected for the study are active in proprietary software engineering. In this experience report, we discuss to what extent the identified RET alignment challenges apply to the development of a large information system for managing grants from the European Union. We confirm that most of the findings from previous work also apply to the public sector, including the challenges of aligning goals within an organization, specifying high-quality requirements, and verifying quality aspects. Furthermore, we emphasize that the public sector might be impacted by shifting political power, and that several RET alignment challenges are amplified in multi-project environments."

Security requirements such as access or information control tend to increase the complexity of functional requirements, and therefore, need to be correctly implemented to minimize risks. However, general developers find it difficult to correctly specify adequate security requirements during the initial phases of the software development process.  
We propose a method to verify security requirements whose specifications are based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) using the model checking technique and Common Criteria security knowledge. Common Criteria assists in defining adequate security requirements in the form of a table. This helps developers verify whether UML-based requirements analysis models meet those requirements in the early stages of software development.

This paper presents a model-driven testing approach for conceptual schemas that automatically generates a set of abstract test cases, from requirements models. In this way, tests and requirements are linked together to find defects as soon as possible, which can considerably reduce the risk of defects and project reworking. The authors propose a generation strategy which consists of: two meta-models, a set of transformations rules which are used to generate a Test Model, and the Abstract Test Cases from an existing approach to communication-oriented Requirements Engineering; and an algorithm based on Breadth-First Search. A practical application of our approach is included."
